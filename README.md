# Next.js E-Commerce Dashboard & CMS

Welcome to my repository for the Next.js E-Commerce Dashboard & CMS project! In this project, I have developed a full-stack application using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and MySQL.

## Key Features

### Shadcn UI for the Admin

- I integrated the sleek Shadcn UI for this dashboard, giving it a modern and visually appealing design.

### Multi-Purpose Admin Dashboard

- My dashboard serves as a Content Management System (CMS), an administrative tool, and an API hub, all in one place.

### Vendor & Store Management

- Control multiple vendors and stores through a single CMS. For example, you can manage a "Shoe store," a "Laptop store," and a "Suit store," with CMS generating API routes for each of them independently.

### Category Management

- Create, update, and delete categories effortlessly, offering a flexible way to organize your products.

### Product Management

- Easily manage your product catalog with features for creating, updating, and deleting products.

### Image Management

- Upload multiple images for products and change them at any time to keep your product listings up-to-date.

### Filter Management

- Create, update, and delete filters such as "Color" and "Size," and seamlessly associate them with product listings during creation.

### Billboard Management

- Customize prominent text sections on your website using "Billboards." Attach them to specific categories or use them as standalone elements.

### Advanced Search

- Search through categories, products, sizes, colors, and billboards with included pagination, providing an efficient browsing experience.

### Featured Products

- Highlight select products by marking them as "featured" to ensure they appear prominently on the homepage.

### Analytics and Insights

- Gain valuable insights into your business with features like order tracking, sales monitoring, and revenue graphs.

### Authentication and Payment

- Clerk Authentication, order creation, integrated Stripe checkout, and handle Stripe webhooks.

### Database and ORM

- Utilize MySQL with Prisma and PlanetScale to efficiently manage the data and ensure seamless scalability.
